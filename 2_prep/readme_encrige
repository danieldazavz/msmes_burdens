Processing of the ENCRIGE database

The ENCRIGE 2020 database originally had 29,482 observations, of which 24,128 remain when filtering the database according to the municipalities of interest. By eliminating companies from the transportation, mining, energy, financial services, and outsourcing sectors, the number of observations is reduced to 21,712. After this, all observations reporting an NA value in any of the variables of interest are eliminated, resulting in a sample of 21,653 firms. Finally, all observations that had a value of 0 in the administrative burdens per employee variable, i.e., firms that did not incur regulatory costs, are eliminated. In this step, the sample is reduced to 14,119 observations, and it finally ends up with 12,241 companies after eliminating, using the interquartile range method, the outliers of the independent variable.
