Scripts description

4_ce_vardis
The script analyzes the distribution of independent and dependent variables in the final dataset, focusing on descriptive statistics, histograms, and skewness.

5_reg_productivity
Using linear regression models, the script analyzes the relationship between administrative burdens and business productivity. It differentiates the analysis by firm size (micro, small, medium, large) and type (formal, informal), considering control variables such as average schooling, labor informality, and population density.

6_reg_size_type
The script performs linear regression analysis to examine how administrative burdens (ca_xe) affect the proportion of firms by type (formal and informal), and size (micro, small, medium, large).

7_reg_size_by_type
The script performs linear regression analysis to evaluate how administrative burdens (ca_xe) affect the proportion of firms by size and type (formal and informal).

Scripts 5, 6, and 7 include the following components:

Visualization: Creates graphs using ggplot2 to illustrate the relationship between administrative burdens and the proportions of companies, categorized by type and size.

Assumption Assessment: Evaluates key statistical assumptions—normality, independence of errors, linearity, and homoscedasticity—through tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Pagan) and residual plots.

Tabular Results: Summarizes model estimates and performance metrics in well-structured tables to facilitate interpretation.

Graph Exporting: Saves visualizations in suitable formats for documentation and future analysis.
